### Problem Statement
There are at present about 44 labour laws for ensuring Decent Work in the country. Mostly, the labour laws are violated by employers to improve competitiveness. Regular / Complaint based Inspections or Self certification system have not been able to address the issue in a balanced way. MoLE has introduced Shram Suvidha Portal for inspection management. A technology based solution for improvement in labour-law compliance while ensuring minimum intrusion into the activities of business is needed.
